# Testing

## Kaggle

### Importing datasets

1. Use `opendatasets` to import datasets from the Kaggle API.
2. Create an API key in the "Account" page in your Kaggle account.
3. Download and add the `kaggle.json` file to the testing directory.
4. *Adding the `kaggle.json` file to the same directory as the jupyter notebook allows the `opendatasets.download()` to automatically read the contents of `kaggle.json`. If not, import it to the notebook.*
