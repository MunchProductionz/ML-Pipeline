# Binary classification
Binary classification refers to the classification tasks that have two class labels.

## Examples

- Email spam detection (spam or not).
- Churn prediction (churn or not).
- Conversion prediction (buy or not).

## Algorithms

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machine
- Naive Bayes

It is common to model a binary classification task with a model that predicts a Bernoulli probability distribution for each example.
