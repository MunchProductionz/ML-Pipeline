# Multi-class classification
Multi-class classification refers to the classification tasks that have more than two class labels.

## Examples

- Face classification.
- Plant species classification.
- Optical character recognition.

## Algorithms

- k-Nearest Neighbors.
- Decision Trees.
- Naive Bayes.
- Random Forest.
- Gradient Boosting.

Algorithms that are designed for binary classification can be adapted for use for multi-class problems.

- *One-vs-Rest:* Fit one binary classification model for each class vs. all other classes.
- *One-vs-One:* Fit one binary classification model for each pair of classes.

Binary classification algorithms that can use these strategies for multi-class classification include:

- Logistic Regression.
- Support Vector Machine.
